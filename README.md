# Hello ladies and gentlemen 🫡

Please follow the instructions below to begin your journey of solving the **Pandemic**:

### Getting Started 🧨

1. **FORK** and **CLONE** this repository.
2. `cd` into the task folder, and **DO NOT FORGET** to run:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   This will install all the magic files (i.e., node_modules).

‼️ Before Writing Any Code

3. TAKE A LOOK at the project — explore it and read through the folder and file structure inside:
   app/
   components/
Understand what each part is expected to render.

4. Start the project by running:

```bash
npm start
```
5. Make sure you can preview the list of trips.

### 📝 Your Task
Inside the app/ folder, create the necessary folders and files to enable the user to:
1. Navigate to the Stays List.
2. Navigate to the Stay Details by clicking on any stay card (via Stack Navigation).
3. Navigate to the Trip Details by clicking on any trip card.


### 📌 Notes
- Trips and Stays should be displayed using Bottom Tabs navigation.
- The active tab should be visually highlighted so the user knows which tab they are currently on.
- Pay attention to nested headers and screen titles — we don’t want to accidentally break the whole app بكبره 😅.

### Desired Outcome:

**Good Luck! 🤞😉**
